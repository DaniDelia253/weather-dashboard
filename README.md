# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard allows the user to see the weather outlook for many cities upon search. Whe the user types a city name into the form input, the page displays the current and future weather conditions for that city. The city name, current date, and icon representation of current weather conditions, and weather information including the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index are displayed. The UV index is displayed in a color-coded badge to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The bottom half of the page shows a 5-day forcast for the city , with each day showing forecasted weather conditions 9in the form of an icon), the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When the user searches for a city, it is added to the search history and a button with the name of the city is formed under the input form. The user can clish on the search history buttons to display weather infomation for those cities again.
